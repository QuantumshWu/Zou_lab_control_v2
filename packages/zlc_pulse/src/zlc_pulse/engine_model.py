"""Cycle-accurate behavioural models of the FINAL affine edge-table engine
(``fpga/pulse_streamer/zlc_edge_streamer.v``), used to prove tick-exactness +
gaplessness BEFORE hardware (the second pre-hardware layer is the xsim
testbenches in ``fpga/pulse_streamer/sim/`` running the real RTL).

Three models, all walking the SAME engine FSM:

* :func:`reference_play` -- the *combinatorial* ground truth: every cycle it reads
  the current edge in-line and fires same-cycle on ``time_count == effective_tick``
  (this is the behaviour the design must reproduce; min edge spacing = 1 tick).

* :func:`prefetch_play` -- the BRAM engine's EDGE path: edge tables in block RAM
  (synchronous ``read_latency``-cycle read behind a REGISTERED address, so the true
  issue->data-valid latency is read_latency+1), hidden by a depth-(latency+2)
  continuous prefetch FIFO + edge/loop-start shadows, so the four gapless reload
  sites reseed instantly and back-to-back **1-tick** edges still fire one per cycle.
  Proven == reference for latency 1 AND 2.

* :func:`streaming_scan_play` -- the SCAN path: the scan-point table is a 2-bank
  ping-pong window of ``bank_size`` points; the sole host observer refills the
  idle bank behind the engine cursor.  This model verifies the active refill
  handshake against reference and proves STALL (hold, never a wrong point) on a
  late refill.  Production treats any observed UNDERFLOW as a failed run; the
  FPGA remains the autonomous owner of point timing.

The RTL combines the edge FIFO and the scan ping-pong; each is verified here
independently and against the same ``reference_play`` ground truth.

The OUTPUT delay differs by signal kind.  A TTL channel is a per-bit EVENT SCHEDULER:
:func:`delay_line_reference` is the exact stream-shift ground truth (out[t]=in[t-d], 0 before
fire) and :func:`rtl_delay_line_mirror` is its cycle-exact register mirror.  A DAC bus is an
INSTRUCTION-LEVEL SEGMENT delay: :func:`bus_delay_line_reference` is the same out[t]=in[t-d]
ground truth (safe = BUS_SAFE_VALUE before fire), and :func:`rtl_bus_segment_delay_mirror`
mirrors the RTL that captures each RESOLVED segment (:func:`bus_undelayed_and_log`) and re-plays
it d ticks later -- so a delayed dense ramp costs ONE descriptor, not ~span events.  Both use the
32-bit delay field (a d past it raises :class:`DelayTooLargeError`).  ``reference_play`` /
``prefetch_play`` / ``rtl_mirror_play`` apply the channel delay line as a post-play shift via
:func:`_apply_channel_delays`.

#   (visible at t + d).  d==1 is served by the prev-undelayed register; d==0 bypasses.
#
#   DAC (rtl_bus_segment_delay_mirror): INSTRUCTION-LEVEL, one per-bus FIFO (g_busseg) of RESOLVED
#   segment descriptors, NOT per-bit value events.  On each apply push {emit = g_time + d, ramp
#   descriptor}; a delayed re-player pops it at emit and RE-RUNS the ramp stepper d ticks later, so
#   the whole DAC value shifts coherently.  d==1 is the prev register; before the first emit the
#   bus holds BUS_SAFE_VALUE.  Storage scales with SEGMENTS in flight (<= the FIFO depth), so a
#   delayed dense/long ramp is ONE descriptor -- density/swing no longer overflow.
#
#   TTL storage scales with value-change events in flight per bit; DAC with segments in flight.
#   Both are out[t]=in[t-d] before any overflow, == the *_reference functions (TTL safe 0, DAC safe
#   = BUS_SAFE_VALUE), with an in-flight-count capacity bound instead of a delay-length cap.
